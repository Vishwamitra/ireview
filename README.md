# About the application
An app for customers to be able to provide review about the products listed.

# Structure

Entire application is divided in to 3 services - Frontend (React), REST API (Python Flask) and Database (Postgres).
### Source code
for each services resides in `services` folder. Each services has got its own docker file inside which can be used to generate a `docker image`.
To build an image and spin up you can  use the following command:

```docker build -t ireview-frontend:1.0.0 -f ./services/frontend/Dockerfile .```

```docker build -t ireview-api:1.0.0 -f ./services/api/Dockerfile .```

```docker build -t ireview-db:1.0.0 -f ./services/db/Dockerfile .```

### Docker-Compose
There is a `docker-compose` file created in order to spin up the entire application locally to test it before deploying it in to kubernetes. `docker-compose.yml`

Run the following command to spin up the application locally via docker-compose:

``` docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yaml ```

### Kubernetes Services, Deployments, ConfigMap, Secreted, Storage, Networkpolicy etc. [all other artifacts]

Before creating helm charts, we have created these kubernetes artifacts separately for each services in following folders:
`./architecture/frontend/old/` `./architecture/api/old/` `./architecture/db/old/`

In order to install via above artifacts, you need to run one by one all the files like following example:

``` kubectly apply -f deployments.yaml ``` 

### Helm Charts

In order to deploy the services in Kubernetes with one single commands, we have created helm charts for each services. They can be found in following folders
`./architecture/frontend/helm/` `./architecture/api/helm/`  `./architecture/db/helm/`


## Installation using helm Chart (single command)
This is the single command required in order to install the entire application.
``` > sh install.sh ``` 

Above script calls following helm charts in order to deploy them in kubernetes inside a namespace called ireview-app

#### Create namespace
Use following command to create a new namespace before running the following commands:

``` kubectl create namespace ireview-app ``` 

``` helm install postgres ./architecture/db/helm/postgres/ -n ireview-app``` 

``` helm install api ./architecture/api/helm/api -n ireview-app``` 

``` helm install frontend ./architecture/frontend/helm/frontend -n ireview-app```


## Uninstallation using Helm chart (using single command)

This is the single command required in order to install the entire application.
``` > sh uninstall.sh ``` 

Above script calls following helm charts in order to deploy them in kubernetes inside a namespace called ireview-app


``` helm uninstall frontend -n ireview-app ``` 

``` helm uninstall api -n ireview-app ``` 

``` helm uninstall postgres -n ireview-app ``` 

## Upgrade
For a new version of the software following command is used to upgrade the services: 

``` $ kubectl upgrade frontend frontend/ -n ireview-app``` 

```  $ kubectl upgrade api api/ -n ireview-app``` 

``` $ kubectl upgrade db db/ -n ireview-app ``` 


## Scaleup/Scale down

In order to scaleup each of our services, you can use the following command to increase the number of replicas:

``` $ kubectl scale --replicas 2 deployment/frontend -n ireview-app``` 

``` $ kubectl scale --replicas 3 deployment/api -n ireview-app ``` 

``` $ kubectl scale --replicas 2 deployment/postgres -n ireview-app ```
